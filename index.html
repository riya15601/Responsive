            <p class="text-bg">Why we should learn coding?</p>
            <p class="text-sm">In almost any field, coding skills can boost your career. That's because an ability to code can take your career to the next level. Consider a business analyst who learns how to code. They can open new opportunities,
                 including in business analytics and data science,
                  with coding skills. Or coding can help them stand out at their next annual review.</p>
                  <p class="text-sm">There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of different industries. 
                    Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment.
                     And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go.</p>

            <p class="text-bg">Coding can boost problem solving and logic skills</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Outside from the implications of coding which look good on a resume, coding actually does boost skills which are actually useful to most jobs. Problem solving and logic are the main two. 
                Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain.</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Coding for most big projects tends to be a collaborative effort. This means having to work as one cog as part of a greater team. 
                Learning how to best interact with bosses and co-workers is an essential work skill, and it can often be developed through coding.</p>

            <p class="text-bg">It open up job opportunities</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Even if you’re applying for a position which has no direct relevancy to coding, it’s still well known as a useful skill. Thus, by having any knowledge of it, you’ll automatically give yourself a foot up on the competition.
                 On top of it being a generally worthwhile skill in most jobs, it also shows that you’re hardworking, dynamic, and a self-starter.</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Coding is the fundamental skill for jobs such as software development. 
                There is currently a shortage of software developers worldwide, so learning to code can be an easy route into an open field of work. However, this isn’t the only way coding can open up job opportunities.</p>

            <p class="text-bg">Being a skilled coder can build confidence</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Knowing you have a desirable skill in a competitive job market can help you become more confident in your own abilities. It’s also quite an addictive process – the more you learn, the more you’ll want to learn. 
                Knowing that any problem which could stump most people is easily solved by you is empowering.</p>
            <p class="text-sm">Unlike a lot of items on a position’s person specification, like a university degree, pretty much anyone can learn to code. It doesn’t take several years or cost thousands. 
                In fact, it can pretty much be done online and from the comfort of your own home, and can be learned flexibly around your other commitments.</p>
